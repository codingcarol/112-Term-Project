Your Calendar
This is a calendar app where you can create events to organize your week.
There are three types of events: strict events, recurring events, and flexible events
strict events - one event at one time for a certain date
recurring events - events you want to happen every week on certain days of the week
flexible events - events you know the number of days per week and duration for but have no specific time in mind

Libraries: csv, datetime, calendar, os, string
How to Use: 
- run the main.py file
- Make a new schedule in the data section by making a new folder in this data folder. Then change the app.schedule_folder variable in the main.py file to whatever you named this file. Within each file, make a folder called 'flexible_event_records', and files called 'flexible_events.csv', 'recurring_strict_events.csv', and 'strict_events.csv'
